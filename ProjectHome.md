[EveryBlock.com](http://www.everyblock.com/) is an experimental news Web site that provides information at a "microlocal" level — by neighborhood or city block. It was funded by a grant from [Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfdn.org/), which requires the site's backend code to be open-sourced. Here is the code.

## Overview ##

In an effort to make the code useful to as many people as possible, we've split it into several packages:

  * The main package (probably the thing you're looking for) is the publishing system, known as ebpub.
  * Second, the packages ebdata and ebgeo contain Python modules for processing data and making maps.
  * Third, the packages ebinternal and everyblock round out the code that powers EveryBlock.com. They're internal tools and are likely not of general use, but we're including them to be complete.
  * Finally, ebblog and ebwiki are our blog and wiki software, respectively. Because, dammit, the world needs another Django-powered blogging tool.
